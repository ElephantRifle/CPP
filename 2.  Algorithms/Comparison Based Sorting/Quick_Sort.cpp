/*
How it works: Picks a pivot element, partitions the array around it, and recursively 
sorts the partitions.
Time Complexity:

Best case: 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
Worst case: 𝑂(𝑛2)    (rare, when the pivot is poorly chosen)
Space Complexity: 𝑂(log𝑛)  (average case for recursion)

//This is the code to put a pivot at its correct place
